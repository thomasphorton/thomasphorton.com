It's been a long time since the last weekly recap, eh? I've had two projects keeping me occupied during our isolation in Upstate NY.

## Things I've Worked On
* Refactored DHTs to use IoT ThingShadows
* Move config files in code to SPIFFs
* Pi Rover
    * Works with AWS IoT
    * Added a camera
    * Set up amplify app to view images


# Raspberry Pi Rover

The first is a [4WD rover kit from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/coretec-tiny-4wd-robot-rover). 


### P.S.
Well- it's been two months since my last "weekly recap", so I'm not sure if that's a good name for it. I definitely want a place to write down general updates and not feel like I need to write out a whole documented tutorial.
